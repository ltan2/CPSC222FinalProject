## Description:
For this project, I attempt to visualize and grasp patters associated with my social media used, particularly facebook and instagram. I analyze my usage across days and also identify times (before or after 5pm), which I am more active on social media. Later, I attempt to train the kNN neighbors classifier and Decision Tree Classifier, to predict if I will be before or after 5pm given a day. Later, I also try to understand external factors that could influence my used of social media

### Files:
There are three files .ipynb files for this project. 
The Project.ipynb contains the big picture analysis complete with introduction, visuals, hypothesis testing, classification, conclusion etc. 
The Classification.ipynb contains code specific only to classification and the cleaned up of the data for the classification  
The HypothesisTesting.ipynb contains code specific to hypothesis testing as well as all the detailed cleanup.
* Please read the project.ipynb to understand and analyze my code better

### Installation:
You can pull the files in this repository, but just make sure they are in the same folder, so that everything can run

### Support:  
You can contact me for any issues about the code. More than happy to help

### Acknowledgment:
I want to thank my CPSC 222 professor Dr.Gina Sprint
